		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
		
		<p>When this unit first began, I had no idea what to expect since all my previous coding experiences have not been the greatest.
			I had always struggled to grasp the concept and everything I learned went in one ear and out the other.
			This unit has helped me learn all the need to know basics of programming, and now I feel more confident in my web developing skills. 
			An example of things that I learned is that you can break your text and organize your code however you want, in any way that satisfies you
			and it will not affect the thing that you are programming. Along with this I learned most of the basic tags, and now when I read code I'm not as 
			intimidated and confused. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Things that I found informative:</li>
			<li>The step by step tutorial we followed</li>
			<li>The table of the tags and what they were for</li>
			<li>The video tutorials that went along with the website</li>
		</ul>
